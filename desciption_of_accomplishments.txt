Description of Project Accomplishments

Author: Steamly Steamy Steamers

In this project, we simulated the database of a steam-like game site.
We have two kind of users: company and player. Both users are able to 
log onto their type of account. Players, on their homepage, can
filter and search for games, view their actions/history through querying
(achievement, transaction records, etc.) In addition, they can carry out
actions such as changing their balance and request statistics from of the
server. As for companies, they are able to declare bankruptcy, thus deleting
the games they have (unless under constraints). In addition, companies can 
check out which player is the most loyal and bought all of the company's 
games More importantly, we have also have learned how to integrate 
HTML, PHP and SQL together to create an interesting web page. 
While coding the pages, we have also encountered few things that 
were discussed in class, such as locks and timestamps 
(no deleting when multiple user logs onto the db, and action
executed right after the lock is lifted/other users logged out).
