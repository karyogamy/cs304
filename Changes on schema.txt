Our final schema is basically the same as the one we handed in 
for formal specification. The differences comes from bug fixes 
of our original schema, such as typo and ordering. We also
accidentally had aid(achievement id) and gid(game id) together 
as the primary key for has_achievement when we should only have 
aid as the primary key. We also added in some NOT NULL constraints

Otherwise the schema is the same.
