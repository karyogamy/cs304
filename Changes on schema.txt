Changes on Schema
- Author: Steamly Steamy Steamers

Our final schema is basically the same as the one we handed in for formal specification. The differences comes from bug fixes of our original schema, such as typo and ordering. We also accidentally had aid(achievement id) and gid(game id) together as the primary key for has_achievement when we should only have aid as the primary key. We also added in some NOT NULL constraints. The hour_played attribute of game is removed because we don’t think it’s needed. We also added in an update constraint and delete on cascade. 

Otherwise the schema is the same.
